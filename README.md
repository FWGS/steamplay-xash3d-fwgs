# Steam Play - FTEQW

**At this moment, this tool is unfinished and only exists as an experiment and
doesn't do anything of what's described below. But it will, at some point.**

If you'd like a convenient way to run Half-Life mods on Linux and macOS, then
this is the right tool for you.

It will automatically keep Xash3D FWGS updated, download native mod libraries
if available, or run the mod under Wine.

# Dependencies
* `/bin/bash` to be Bash
* `wget` to download archives

# Installation
In order to install it, you just clone
the repository into your $HOME/.steam/steam/compatibilitytools.d/ directory.

If the directory 'compatibilitytools.d' does not exist, make sure to create it.

# Special Thanks
Thanks for `steam-play-fteqw` for inspiration!
