# Steam Play - FTEQW

If you'd like a convenient way to use your system binary of FTEQW
in order to run games such as:

- Quake
- Quake Mission Pack 1: Scourge of Armagon
- Quake Mission Pack 2: Dissolution of Eternity
- Quake II
- Quake II Mission Pack 1: The Reckoning
- Quake II Mission Pack 2: Ground Zero
- Quake III Arena
- Quake III: Team Arena
- HeXen II

Then this is the right tool for you.

# Dependencies
None, it expects your /bin/sh to handle arrays and things though.
And you want fteqw installed. Put it into $HOME/bin if that's in your $PATH
or something. You'll figure it out.

# Installation
In order to install it, you just clone
the repository into your $HOME/.steam/steam/compatibilitytools.d/ directory.

If the directory 'compatibilitytools.d' does not exist, make sure to create it.
